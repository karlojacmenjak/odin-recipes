    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar. </li>
        <li>Butter: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. </li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure. </li>
        <li>Cocoa powder: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty. </li>
        <li>Chocolate chips: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. </li>
        <li>Walnuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another. </li>
        <li>Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, then stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. </li>
        <li>Drop the dough onto baking sheets. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set. </li>
    </ol>
